## EfficientNav: On-Device Object-Goal Navigation with Navigation Map Caching and Retrieval
This is also the official code repository for the paper [EfficientNav](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18546).

EfficientNav is a novel framework that enables efficient on-device Object Goal Navigation (ObjNav) using smaller language models. Developing LLM-based navigation system on local device is challenging, due to the **limited model capacity of smaller LLM planner** for understanding complex navigation maps.
At the same time, the **long prompt introduced by the navigation map description** will cause high planning latency on local devices. 
This project tackles the critical challenges of deploying LLM-based navigation agents on local devices by efficient navigation map caching and retrieval.

## Key Features 🚀 
- **Semantics-Aware Memory Retrieval**: Prunes redundant information in navigation maps to enhance smaller LLMs' environment understanding

- **Discrete Memory Caching**: Efficiently saves and reuses KV cache to reduce planning latency

- **Attention-Based Memory Clustering**: Recovers memory interactions for better model performance

- On the HM3D dataset, EfficientNav significantly reduces KV-cache recomputation and memory usage while improving navigation success rates—**even outperforming GPT-4-based planners**

## Installation
Assuming you have conda installed, let's prepare a conda env:
```
conda create -n habitat python=3.9 cmake=3.14.0
conda activate habitat
```
Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install habitat-sim:
```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim.git
cd habitat-sim
conda install habitat-sim headless -c conda-forge -c aihabitat
```
Install habitat-lab:
```
git clone --branch stable https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab.git
cd habitat-lab
pip install -e habitat-lab
pip install -e habitat-baselines
```
Object detection is handled through a ROS 2 detection service. In this local setup,
GroundingDINO is installed in the ROS workspace at `/home/min/DINO_ws`, not inside
this repository.

Start the detection node in a separate terminal:
```
source /home/min/DINO_ws/install/setup.bash
python3 -m efficientnav_detection.detection_node
```
